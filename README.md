## Banner AI
Banner is focused on building a personal location-based assistant that provides users with the ability to retrieve information about and interact with places in their current vicinity in real-time.

Here is the continuously evolving project plan:
[Banner Project](https://github.com/users/moellejc/projects/2/views/1)

## Beta Release
The Banner Beta is planned for late Spring / early Summer 2025.

## Beta Target Features
- User location and place identification
- Updated location as the user moves
- AI Assistant conversations centered around the user's current location
- Saved conversations
- Adjustable location scope hierarchy hyper-localized to broad geospatial regions
- User authentication

## Future Features
- Managed corpus of data for specific locations and places the Assistant can respond with
- Integrated tools specific to each place enabling user interactions (i.e. ordering, check-in/out, customer service, real-time stats / info, interior directions, etc.)
- Extended personalization based on past conversations and interactions
- Interactions with other users and assistants nearby
- Location ownership and management verification
- AR integration! ðŸ˜®

## Banner History
Banner has been a side project over the past couple of years originally built to explore new technologies I have limited exposure to in my day-to-day tech consulting life. I've always been interested in the concept if a personal local assistant but only recently has the technology come to life to start making this concept a reality. The Banner project originally manifested as a React Native mobile app and Express GraphQL & Prisma backend, then updated to a Drizzle and REST based ORM and API, then a short Monorepo and [T3](https://create.t3.gg/)stack stint, and finally landing on a web-based NextJS chatbot architecture.

All tech stack iterations would have been valid but I wanted to implement something quicker that I could use on a daily basis and not have to worry about the chatbot infrastructure and tooling. I also wanted to learn more about NextJS ðŸ˜‰.

Additionally, I'm going to be focusing on the web-based approach over mobile for now to simplify UI and frontend / backend communication. I want to focus on learning more about vector databases, AI agents, MCP servers & tools, and AI benchmark / test case valuation over having the perfect app.
